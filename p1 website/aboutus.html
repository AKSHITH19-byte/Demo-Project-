        <h1>About BBS Rural India Foundadtion </h1>
        <p class="i1">
        B.B.S(Baba Butan Singh) Rural India Foundation has been founded with an intention 
        to advance the growth of rural society. Youth are unemployed & disguised unemployment is the biggest problem.
        Here the B.B.S Rural Indian Foundation aim to propagate awareness among people & help them with self-employment
        process. This organization is based on working principle of altruism. We believe that no social change can be 
        brought without paying proper devotion & fragmenting. Rural Society is a close society & many times it bans 
        progressive change to inter it.
        </p>
        <h1 class="ab1">Vision And Mission </h1>
        <p class="i2">
        Baba Butan Singh Rural India Foundation (BBSRIF)is committed to social justice, sustainable development

        aim to supplement rather than replace governmental efforts. They are implemented on a large scale to not 
        only reach as many children as possible, but also to create an adoptable demonstration model for state 
        governments.
